[Fira][0] is the name of Mozillas type family for Firefox OS. It looks nice, but is still under development. One issue (at least for me), is that the when I use bold text on a line, it changes the line-height of that line, resulting in non-equal line-spacing in the paragraph.

Still though, its nice to see that more and more open sourced type faces are showing up.
